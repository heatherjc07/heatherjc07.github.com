I always have a bit of anxiety around the fact that technology and Kainos continue to move on without me.  KIT, Keeping in Touch days can help with this. KIT days allow you to work, earning a days wage without affecting your maternity pay. What form this work takes is something you agree with your employer. For example it could be typical day to day work, training or attending a conference. Despite this being my third maternity leave I have never made use of a KIT day . I didn’t know they existed when I had Luke. I’ve breastfed the younger two and so not been in a position to leave them for any length of time. They are not bottle fans."

Luke combined with a role with more responsibility have left me feeling pretty tired and this time I didn’t escape the dreaded morning sickness.

The interviews illustrate how the reality of being a tech lead differs from their expectations. The tech leads talk about the skills they’ve had to develop along the way and the lessons they’ve learnt. It is an easy read due to the interview format. I would recommend it to senior developers looking to make the transition as it is an insight into what a day being a tech lead involves."

One from a developer perspective, learning about creating a blog with MongoDB using python, and the other from a DBA perspective. There is also one near the end of February using Java and MongoDB which I plan to take a look at. I’ll let you know how they go and whether I’d recommend them. I find it really useful at times having deadlines whether imposed by others like these courses or by myself, e.g. by committing to a talk about a subject. With so many things vying for my time it can be easy to make excuses for not getting round to looking at things. Deadlines give me the kick up the backside I need to get things done."

In the past you’ve probably used a range of different RDBMS like Sybase, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server, and forced your data to fit in the relational model. NoSQL doesn’t mean no more relational databases. Instead it means there are a range of different models and database options to meet your particular domain needs."

As someone full of enthusism with lots of things I want to look at but limited time I’m constantly striving for ways to become more effective in the time I do have. One thing that really caught my eye in the book was the idea of a personal kanban board. It seems like a great way to capture the things I want to do/achieve and make sure I complete them so I’m going to give it a go."

Its part of the reason why I’ve volunteered to present so much recently in work, combined with the fact that I’ve been inspired by what I’ve been working on both at work and in my spare time.I’m naturally a shy person who doesn’t particularly enjoy being the centre of attention so talking to an audience especially about something that splits opinion or which people disagree with my view on is something I’m not particularly comfortable doing. I know however it is a key part of being a good developer especially if you want to progress. Currently I’m in the process of desensitising myself to the fear of criticism by taking every opportunity to present and lead and I can definitely feel it becoming easier."

Thomas Fuchs has created a site, microjs ,to help make people aware of the best Micro-Frameworks and show how compact and powerful they can be. His aim is to encourage people to make an active choice about the right JavaScript Framework for their project and not just plump for the current defacto choice. I intend to take a look  through some of the frameworks and read the code behind a few of them with the aim to improving my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript . I’m hoping reading the code behind a well written Micro-Framework will be an education in how to write good JavaScript because of their size and the fact they focus on one problemThere are two main reasons why you would look at using Micro-Frameworks. The first is to give you functionality which your main framework does not provide. Here you would use it in addition to your main framework. The second is if you feel that the cost on performance of using a large library, which provides a range of functionality, is too high for the benefits it gives you. Perhaps you only require a small subset of the power it provides. With the performance of websites being an important factor in retaining customers it’s natural that developers are looking for ways to reduce the amount of code loading to improve page load times. In this case a micro framework or combination of micro frameworks to create a custom framework might prove the best solution.When selecting a Micro-Framework for either reason a developer must remember to consider all of the factors they would normally look at when selecting a framework.

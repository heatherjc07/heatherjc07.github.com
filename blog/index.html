I always have a bit of anxiety around the fact that technology and Kainos continue to move on without me.  KIT, Keeping in Touch days can help with this. KIT days allow you to work, earning a days wage without affecting your maternity pay. What form this work takes is something you agree with your employer. For example it could be typical day to day work, training or attending a conference. Despite this being my third maternity leave I have never made use of a KIT day . I didn’t know they existed when I had Luke. I’ve breastfed the younger two and so not been in a position to leave them for any length of time. They are not bottle fans.</span></a></article></li>

Committing to at least ten pages a day. I’ve found this approach worked well for me when I was getting back into shape after having Marc. Ten minutes of exercise first thing and after the kids have gone to bed has become a regular part of my day. I feel healthier and happier because of it.</span></a></article></li>

I decided to come back a couple of weeks before Christmas to ease myself in. January can be a bit of a bleak month in general and adding on returning to work didn’t feel like a good plan.</span></a></article></li>

None of the episodes are long with each one averaging less than 20 mins. A lot of the podcasts I enjoy are an hour or more in length so it is a nice addition to have one which is shorter for when I want a quick burst of inspiration.</span></a></article></li>
 
  <li><article><a href="http://heatherjcampbell.com/tutorial/functional-programming-with-java/">Functional Programming with Java <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2015-10-22T00:00:00+01:00">October 22, 2015</time></span> <span class="excerpt">I just completed Jessica Kerr’s Pluralsight course Functional Programming with Java. It’s not the first time I’ve played about with Java 8 and its functional features or functional programming in general. I still found the course useful especially as I applied what it covered to a project I worked on several years ago which was purely Object Orientated. This gave me a chance to put it in to practice and get a feel of the benefits this additional functionality provided.</span></a></article></li>
 
  <li><article><a href="http://heatherjcampbell.com/culture/making-time-to-talk/">Making Time to Talk <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2015-10-20T00:00:00+01:00">October 20, 2015</time></span> <span class="excerpt">I recently finished a project and it made me think about the difference taking time to communicate can make to a person. We are always talking about the importance of not calling people resources. The need to make them feel valued. All too often it is easy to get caught up in dramatic gestures  and forget about the impact of day to day interactions.</span></a></article></li>

I’d wanted to go on this for a while as I’ve benefited from being coached in the past. I have a number of people who I currently coach but I was looking forward to some formal training to help me maximise the positive impact I could make. It was a brilliant couple of days with lots of practical to get experience applying what we had learnt.</span></a></article></li>

I’m competitive and want to do well but at the same time my mum gave me and my sister a great childhood staying at home with us so I value spending quality time with my children. I came across I Know How She Does It by Laura Vanderkam and I was interested to see how other women carve out their time.</span></a></article></li>

Over the past few months I’ve been getting to grips with being pregnant again. Turns out a girl can forget what it is like when you leave a 4 year gap between children. I can’t complain as I have had it pretty easy both times. Still there are definitely differences this time. With a four year old running about chances to rest up are hard to find. Luke combined with a role with more responsibility have left me feeling pretty tired and this time I didn’t escape the dreaded morning sickness. Now I’m in my second trimester I can feel my energy coming back and the thought of travel doesn’t fill me with dread (as it did when I was trying to not succumb to sickness)</span></a></article></li>

Highly recommend it as a means of helping anyone understand the benefits of empowerment and the stumbling blocks you’ll experience along the way. Being fiction it is easy to read and remember the message it delivers.</span></a></article></li>

Over the Christmas hols I’ve experienced going from the best feeling in the world to one of the saddest points in my life and it got me thinking about the power of having the right attitude.</span></a></article></li>

Get it up on the wall where it can’t be ignored. That way everyday the team is reminded of it and when it is staring you in the face you tend to take action on it.</span></a></article></li>

It can overwhelm you to the point where you don’t start. If you’re looking for some sound advice check out Trisha Gee’s post on Staying ahead of the curve.</span></a></article></li>
 
  <li><article><a href="http://heatherjcampbell.com/books/review-talking-with-tech-leads/">Review: Talking with Tech Leads <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2014-10-24T00:00:00+01:00">October 24, 2014</time></span> <span class="excerpt">A couple of weeks ago I was having a browse around the books on Leanpub and I came across Talking with Tech Leads by Patrick Kua. The book contains 35 interviews with Tech Leads from first timers to experienced pros. It looks at how they balance the technical and non technical demands. The interviews illustrate how the reality of being a tech lead differs from their expectations. The tech leads talk about the skills they’ve had to develop along the way and the lessons they’ve learnt. It is an easy read due to the interview format. I would recommend it to senior developers looking to make the transition as it is an insight into what a day being a tech lead involves.</span></a></article></li>
 
  <li><article><a href="http://heatherjcampbell.com/books/review-show-your-work/">Review: Show Your Work! <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2014-10-12T00:00:00+01:00">October 12, 2014</time></span> <span class="excerpt">I found Show Your Work! by Austin Kleon an inspiration for getting out there and sharing what you know and do. It’s an easy to read and digest book, split into 10 chapters, each packed with beautiful illustrations.</span></a></article></li>

This post falls under that category and is a review of The Little Book of Lunch.</span></a></article></li>
 
  <li><article><a href="http://heatherjcampbell.com/books/scenius/">Scenius <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2014-08-10T00:00:00+01:00">August 10, 2014</time></span> <span class="excerpt">The first chapter in Austin Kleon’s Show Your Work! introduced me to a brilliant word “Scenius” which he credited muscian Brian Eno with creating. It’s the argument that no great genius existed in a vacuum. Instead they were part of a scene. Interacting with other people, sharing ideas, building on what others had come up with.</span></a></article></li>

The premise of the book is that people don’t always adopt good ideas simply because they are a good idea instead we need to put some thought into how to sell the idea in order to increase the chance of it being adopted. People need to feel the investment of their time/effort/money is going to reap reward.</span></a></article></li>

I’ve decided to start sharing each week things which caught my eye. I admit it’s partly for my benefit to record them so I can come back to them in the future. Hopefully you’ll find them of some benefit too.</span></a></article></li>

Once I factor work, Luke, husband, dog and home in I don’t have a load of me time to do what I want. I was feeling a bit like this the other day when a brilliantly timed email popped into my inbox from Popforms titled ‘Your life is a series of small investments.

For a while I’ve wanted to change the look and feel of my site and I finally got some time over the past week to do it.

If you come from a coding background and are used to working with CSS, HTML and JavaScript you’ve got all the skills to start creating beautiful presentations. There is also an online graphical interface for noncoders or anyone who prefers that.</span></a></article></li>

Definitely harder to pull off than an all talking presentation but a great experience.

With so many things vying for my time it can be easy to make excuses for not getting round to looking at things.

It’s a grouping for databases which don’t adher to the relational database management system model. In the past you’ve probably used a range of different RDBMS like Sybase, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server, and forced your data to fit in the relational model. NoSQL doesn’t mean no more relational databases. Instead it means there are a range of different models and database options to meet your particular domain needs.</span></a></article></li>

Its part of the reason why I’ve volunteered to present so much recently in work, combined with the fact that I’ve been inspired by what I’ve been working on both at work and in my spare time.I’m naturally a shy person who doesn’t particularly enjoy being the centre of attention so talking to an audience especially about something that splits opinion or which people disagree with my view on is something I’m not particularly comfortable doing. I know however it is a key part of being a good developer especially if you want to progress. Currently I’m in the process of desensitising myself to the fear of criticism by taking every opportunity to present and lead and I can definitely feel it becoming easier.</span></a></article></li>

Thomas Fuchs has created a site, microjs ,to help make people aware of the best Micro-Frameworks and show how compact and powerful they can be. His aim is to encourage people to make an active choice about the right JavaScript Framework for their project and not just plump for the current defacto choice. I intend to take a look  through some of the frameworks and read the code behind a few of them with the aim to improving my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript . I’m hoping reading the code behind a well written Micro-Framework will be an education in how to write good JavaScript because of their size and the fact they focus on one problemThere are two main reasons why you would look at using Micro-Frameworks. The first is to give you functionality which your main framework does not provide. Here you would use it in addition to your main framework. The second is if you feel that the cost on performance of using a large library, which provides a range of functionality, is too high for the benefits it gives you. Perhaps you only require a small subset of the power it provides. With the performance of websites being an important factor in retaining customers it’s natural that developers are looking for ways to reduce the amount of code loading to improve page load times. In this case a micro framework or combination of micro frameworks to create a custom framework might prove the best solution.When selecting a Micro-Framework for either reason a developer must remember to consider all of the factors they would normally look at when selecting a framework. These include:</span></a></article></li>

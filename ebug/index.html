  <li><article><a href="http://localhost:4000/books/reading-challenge/">Reading Challenge <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2016-02-02T00:00:00+00:00">February 02, 2016</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Hard to believe I’m nearly 2 months into maternity leave. The days are flying in. Marc arrived on the 15th December and I’m now well outnumbered 3 boys to 1 girl.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="http://localhost:4000/trends/developer-tea/">Developer Tea <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2016-01-21T00:00:00+00:00">January 21, 2016</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Over the past week I’ve started listening to the Developer Tea podcast. None of the episodes are long with each one averaging less than 20 mins. A lot of the podcasts I enjoy are an hour or more in length so it is a nice addition to have one which is shorter for when I want a quick burst of inspiration.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="http://localhost:4000/tutorials/functional-programming-with-java/">Functional Programming with Java <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2015-10-22T00:00:00+01:00">October 22, 2015</time></span> <span class="excerpt">I just completed Jessica Kerr’s Pluralsight course Functional Programming with Java. It’s not the first time I’ve played about with Java 8 and its functional features or functional programming in general. I still found the course useful especially as I applied what it covered to a project I worked on several years ago which was purely Object Orientated. This gave me a chance to put it in to practice and get a feel of the benefits this additional functionality provided.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="http://localhost:4000/culture/making-time-to-talk/">Making Time to Talk <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2015-10-20T00:00:00+01:00">October 20, 2015</time></span> <span class="excerpt">I recently finished a project and it made me think about the difference taking time to communicate can make to a person. We are always talking about the importance of not calling people resources. The need to make them feel valued. All too often it is easy to get caught up in dramatic gestures  and forget about the impact of day to day interactions.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="http://localhost:4000/skills/why-im-bought-in-to-coaching/">Why I'm Bought in to Coaching <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2015-09-26T00:00:00+01:00">September 26, 2015</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Last week I was lucky enough to be sent on a two day coaching course led by Bryan Dunlop. I’d wanted to go on this for a while as I’ve benefited from being coached in the past. I have a number of people who I currently coach but I was looking forward to some formal training to help me maximise the positive impact I could make. It was a brilliant couple of days with lots of practical to get experience applying what we had learnt.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="http://localhost:4000/books/i-know-how-she-does-it/">I Know How She Does It <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2015-08-30T00:00:00+01:00">August 30, 2015</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Early on in my pregnancy I was having one of those moments where I wondered how I was going to manage two small people and a career. I’m competitive and want to do well but at the same time my mum gave me and my sister a great childhood staying at home with us so I value spending quality time with my children. I came across I Know How She Does It by Laura Vanderkam and I was interested to see how other women carve out their time.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="http://localhost:4000/life/just-trying-not-to-lean-out/">Just Trying Not To Lean Out <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2015-07-28T00:00:00+01:00">July 28, 2015</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Long time no post. Over the past few months I’ve been getting to grips with being pregnant again. Turns out a girl can forget what it is like when you leave a 4 year gap between children. I can’t complain as I have had it pretty easy both times. Still there are definitely differences this time. With a four year old running about chances to rest up are hard to find. Luke combined with a role with more responsibility have left me feeling pretty tired and this time I didn’t escape the dreaded morning sickness. Now I’m in my second trimester I can feel my energy coming back and the thought of travel doesn’t fill me with dread (as it did when I was trying to not succumb to sickness)</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="http://localhost:4000/culture/does-everyone-know-theyre-empowered/">Does Everyone Know They're Empowered? <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2015-03-28T00:00:00+00:00">March 28, 2015</time></span> <span class="excerpt">I’ve just finishing reading The Decision Maker based on a recommendation in Kate Matsudaira’s blog post. Highly recommend it as a means of helping anyone understand the benefits of empowerment and the stumbling blocks you’ll experience along the way. Being fiction it is easy to read and remember the message it delivers.</span></a></article></li>

I'm a Technical Architect working for a local firm, married to another techie with two boys and dog. 

I'm a big believer in the importance of community, coming together to learn and share ideas. 

I'm keen to see more females taking on technical roles. I try to encourage and promote this as a city lead at my local Women Who Code chapter.

I'm a Solution Architect working for a local firm, married to another techie with two boys and a little girl. Balancing home and work life can be a challenge but enjoying the role I'm in keeps me motivated when it gets tough.

I'm a big believer in the importance of community, coming together to learn and share ideas. Seeing the passion of others and what they've achieved inspires me to push my self to achieve and learn more.
